# transfer style bot

This repository contains the source code of the Telegram bot, which transfers the style from one image to another. To transfer the style, two neural networks are used:

* [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576). Implementation - Deep Learning School course materials

* [Multi-style Generative Network for Real-time Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06953). Implementation - https://github.com/zhanghang1989/PyTorch-Multi-Style-Transfer

Link to the bot: http://t.me/super_transfer_style_bot



## How to use

You can control the bot by sending these commands:

* `/style_transfer` - style transfer
* `/help` - detailed instructions

To start the transfer of the style, you need:

1. to send the command `/style_transfer`
2. to send one image that needs to be processed
3. to send one image that contains the style
4. to choose a style transfer algorithm
